#Welcome to my Websume!

  This is an interactive resume app that showcases who I am as a programmer as well as what I have accumulated skill-wise.
    #Stack:
      -React framework, and routing 
      -Express server
      -Webpack trans-piling and bundling

  The spinning cubes are projects that I have either made myself, paired with a fellow developer, or an OSS(open-source software) project that I have contributed too.

  To view some of the work I've done simply click on a cube and it will take you to the repository where that app's code lives.

  Navigating to this repo: https://github.com/AbrahamFergie/myEnvironment will connect you with the rest of my relevant work that I did this past week.
